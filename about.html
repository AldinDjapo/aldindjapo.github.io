            Djapo is a musician, guitarist, producer and a DJ, born in Germany
            in 1997. Raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he graduated from
            International University of Sarajevo, department Software
            Engineering. Alongside his studies, he was a coach in the most
            successful swimming club in Bosnian history. Sadly, that bond was
            broken the day he got accepted for the masters degree at KunstUni in
            Linz, department "Postdigital Lutherie". He graduated from Primary
            Musical School Ilidza in Bosnia where he played piano.

            Not so long after that he gained interest in guitar, specifically
            electric guitar mostly because of his favourite band "Metallica".
            Soon after he joins the band "Radar" where he is currently playing
            and writing their first album. He also gained interest in music
            production, specifically techno genre. Until this day he had several
            releases for "Minimalism Records", "Prospect Records" and "Ambi
            Records". Currently he is mostly focused on his Software Engineering
            career and developing his programming skills in the pursuit of a
            better future.

              I produce techno and play guitar in a heavy metal band "Radar". We
              are currently working on our first album and it is expected to be
              out later this year.

              I am programming for couple of years and I am mostly using
              JavaScript, HTML and CSS along with Node.js. My future plan is to
              switch to React and build my carrer form there onwards.

              Swimming is my passion, I have competed in National and
              International competitions and won more than 400 medals. Later in
              my career I continued coaching young kids how to swim.

              In my free time I enjoy sports such as basketball, football and
              swimming. Learning new technologies excites me as well as solving
              various problems.
